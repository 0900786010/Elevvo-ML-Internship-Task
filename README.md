# Elevvo-ML-Internship-Task
Machine Learning Internship Projects ‚Äì Elevvo Pathways

This repository contains the complete set of Machine Learning projects I worked on during my internship at Elevvo Pathways. Each task focuses on solving real-world problems using various supervised, unsupervised, and deep learning techniques.

üöÄ Projects Included

‚Ä¢Student Score Prediction

Built Linear & Polynomial Regression models to predict exam scores.

Performed EDA and visualizations to analyze study-related factors.

‚Ä¢Customer Segmentation

Applied K-Means and DBSCAN clustering on the Mall Customers dataset.

Used PCA for dimensionality reduction and created cluster visualizations.

‚Ä¢Forest Cover Type Classification

Trained Random Forest and XGBoost models for multi-class prediction.

Evaluated performance with confusion matrices and feature importance.

‚Ä¢Loan Approval Prediction

Built Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models.

Addressed imbalanced data using SMOTE and evaluated with precision, recall, and F1-score.

‚Ä¢Movie Recommendation System

Implemented collaborative filtering using the MovieLens dataset.

Evaluated recommendations with Precision@K and explored SVD-based factorization.

‚Ä¢Music Genre Classification

Processed GTZAN dataset with Librosa to extract MFCCs.

Trained ML and CNN-based deep learning models for multi-class classification.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

Languages & Libraries: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Librosa, Keras

Techniques: Regression, Clustering, Classification, Collaborative Filtering, Deep Learning

Evaluation Metrics: R¬≤, RMSE, MAE, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Silhouette Score

üìñ Learning Outcomes

This internship gave me hands-on experience in:

End-to-end ML project development (EDA ‚Üí Modeling ‚Üí Evaluation ‚Üí Visualization)

Handling structured and unstructured datasets (tabular, audio, recommendation data)

Applying both classical ML algorithms and modern deep learning methods

This repository serves as a complete portfolio of my practical ML internship journey at Elevvo Pathways. üöÄ
